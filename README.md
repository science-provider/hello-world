First project in GitHub presenting the mission of science-provider: Finding a Difference in Nature Driving the World 

Our mission is creating a new learning method of science that provides learners a real experience of getting ability to use scientific methods step by step in daily life. It starts from a pre-scientific state of experience of learners and reaches to a research oriented state of their activity. We support various types of motivations of individual learners based on methods including editing movies inspiring learners motivation and giving connections between the knowledge around the leaner’s interest. We provide opportunities to the learners applying the methods learned with us to the learner’s real life to find a difference in nature driving the world.
